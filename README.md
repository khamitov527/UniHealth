Here's a walkthrough of our UniHealth app:

## Inspiration
We wanted to create something that could have a positive influence on the USF community and solve a problem faced by the student population. We found that there are many benefits related to tracking food information but USF students cannot reap these benefits because this process is difficult to do with the food served at the dining halls. We also realized that students would benefit by being able to view the menus of the dining halls and their locations. This is especially valuable for freshmen who are unfamiliar with the USF campus.

## What it does
The app we built allows students to browse through the different dining locations on campus and view the menus. Users can view different food and select the items they wish to track. Users are also able to view the location of the dining halls using the map feature we built. Users can also view the history of all the food they have eaten.

## How we built it
We used Swift to build the functionality of the app. We used Parse and Back4App to store data on the users and the food they have eaten.

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled to implement the database using Parse. It was difficult to figure out how to track the food that users have eaten.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the design of the app. We are proud of the map feature that we built. We are proud of the fact that we figured out how to allow users to sign in or create an account and save their information on the food they ate.

## What we learned
We learned how to work with Databases and create individual users for our app. We learned a lot about Git and working together as a team. We learned how to track data and use UI features to interact with databases

## What's next for UniHealth
We want to Partner with USF Dining and use their data on the food they serve. We want to Track more information on the food items such as Sugars, Fats, Proteins, etc. We also want to add a recommendation feature that shows users what food they should eat in order to have a balanced diet. We started out with the intention of using this app solely with USF but we believe this app could be used on campuses around the country.
